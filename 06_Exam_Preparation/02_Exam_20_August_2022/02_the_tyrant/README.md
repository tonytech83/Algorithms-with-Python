2. **The Tyrant**

Lord Vetinari has tasked you with a strange request. He is playing a long-distance game with the lord of Überwald.
The rules are simple by given a **sequence of positive integers** you need to find the **minimum sum subsequence from the array such that at least one value among all groups of four consecutive elements is picked**. And since Lord Vetinari is bored of that game you have been tasked to create a program that calculates the solution.
## **Input**
- The input will come from the console on a single line as a sequence of integers 
## **Output**
- The output is a single integer that represents the minimum sum.
## **Constraints**
- The input will contain only positive integers.
## **Examples**

| **Input**|**Output**|
|:----| :-: |
| 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8|6|
| 11 34 23 8 1 3 5 13 4 69|13|
